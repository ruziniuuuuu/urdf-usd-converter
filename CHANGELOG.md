# Unreleased

## Features

- Added static GLB mesh conversion using trimesh, including node transforms, normals, UVs, PBR material factors, and embedded base-color, normal, emissive, and metallic-roughness textures

# 0.3.3

## Fixes

- Fixed `physics:body0` to reference the closest ancestor with a rigid body, rather than a ghost link that has none
  - `UsdPhysics` already resolved such references by walking ancestors, so this does not change how the articulation is parsed; it makes the authored relationship more intuitive so consumers can read `body0` directly
  - The `origin` of any fixed joints dropped along the way is accumulated into `physics:localPos0` / `physics:localRot0`
- Ghost links no longer emit empty `over` prims into the Physics layer
- Fixed `physics:principalAxes` to be derived from the body-frame inertia tensor, the same source as `newton:inertia`
  - Previously the axes were eigendecomposed from the unrotated URDF tensor and `origin.rpy` was composed on afterward, which did not preserve the eigenvector sign convention
- Fixed eigenvalue degeneracy detection to use a relative tolerance, so principal axes depend on the inertia tensor's shape rather than its magnitude
- Fixed an invalid zero `physics:principalAxes` authored when `<inertial>` specifies `origin` and `mass` but no `<inertia>`
  - Principal axes and diagonal inertia are now authored only when an inertia tensor is present

# 0.3.2

## Fixes

- Fixed `newton:inertia` body-frame transform to account for inertial `origin.rpy`
- Fixed `newton:mimicCoef0` authoring to be in degrees for angular followers
  - URDF authors `<mimic offset>` in the follower joint's position units (radians for revolute and continuous)
  - NewtonMimicAPI documents coef0 in degrees, so angular need to be converted
  - Prismatic followers were already correct as were coef1, which is dimensionless.
  - Important: Newton 1.4 and older fail to handle the degrees-to-radians conversion for `coef0` when loading USD assets
    - This is fixed in Newton 1.5 and newer

# 0.3.1

## Fixes

- Stopped assigning an articulation root when there are no joints. Jointless URDFs are unarticulated props
- Improved error messages for invalid float3/float4 attributes in the source data
- Fixed a load error that occurred when material names or material ids are missing in Collada (DAE) files

# 0.3.0

## Features

- Added conversion support for `<dynamics>` friction & damping as well as `<limits>` velocity via `NewtonJointAPI`

## Fixes

- Fixed principal axes orientation extracted from the URDF inertia tensor with non-zero products of inertia
  - Previouly, the authored `physics:principalAxes` did not correctly reconstruct the URDF inertia tensor via `R * diag * R^T`, it had the correct eigenvalues, but the wrong orientation.

## Dependencies

- Updated to newton-usd-schemas>=0.4.0

# 0.2.0

## Features

- Inertia is now exported as a double[6] tensor via `NewtonMassAPI`, allowing exact URDF inertia to be round-tripped without decomposition.
  - The traditional `PhysicsMassAPI` principal axes & diagonal inertia are also exported for applications that do not read the `newton:inertia` attribute.

## Dependencies

- Updated to newton-usd-schemas>=0.3.1

# 0.1.3

## Fixes

- Changed interpretation for ghost links
  - Intermediate links with explicit 0 mass, 0 inertia, no visual/collision shapes, and connected via fixed joints are now also treated as Ghost Links (previously only leaf links were considered)
  - Ghost links with explicit 0 mass & 0 inertia no longer have PhysicsMassAPI applied

# 0.1.2

## Fixes

- Changed interpretation for leaf ghost links
  - When a chain of fixed joints connects links with no visual/collision/intertia data, those joints are ignored & those links are considered non-physics Xform prims in USD (i.e. no `RigidBodyAPI` will be applied).
- Enhanced error checking for mimic joints

# 0.1.1

## Fixes

- Fixed incorrect joint body0 targets for URDF files containing a Ghost Link

# 0.1.0

## Features

- Added support for the local `file://` protocol for external references (meshes and textures)
- Applied all current Newton USD Schemas (v0.1.0) alongside UsdPhysics schemas
  - URDF joint mimics are now converted via `NewtonMimicAPI`

## Fixes

- Corrected inertia calculations to be consistent across platforms during eigenvector decomposition 

## Dependencies

- Updated to usd-exchange>=2.2.2
- Updated to newton-usd-schemas>=0.1.0

# 0.1.0b1

## Features

- Calibration, Dynamics, Safety Controller, and Mimic are all converted as custom attributes on the Joint prim
- Convert custom elements as Scopes and custom attributes with `custom` and `urdf:` namespace
- Adapted link handling for URDF's "ghost link" convention, where the first link may be a
  purely used to identifiy fixed vs floating articulations

## Fixes

- Stopped triangulating OBJ meshes to support n-gons
- Fixed handling of URDF materials with no material name

## Documentation

- Added benchmarks reporting for several URDF datasets
- Added documentation on how to specify ROS packages

# 0.1.0a2

## Features

- Added conversion of DAE embedded materials to `UsdPreviewSurface` materials
- Improved performance by optimizing numpy processing when converting STL, OBJ, and DAE meshes

## Fixes

- Fixed several DAE mesh conversion issues
  - Fixed to correctly parse even when the DAE file structure is corrupted
  - Fixed an issue where the UV array could not be acquired correctly in some cases
  - Fixed `familyType` attribute when meshes contain subsets
- Fixed OBJ per-face material assignments via `UsdGeomSubsets`
- Fixed material overrides beween native URDF & embedded OBJ/DAE materials
  - We now match `rviz` & `urdfviewer` where embedded OBJ/DAE materials take priority over URDF materials
- Fixed texture wrapping behaviour using `repeat` mode on all `UsdUvTexture` shaders
  - The `wrapMode` is exposed on the material interface so users can change it as needed
- Fixed color issue related to the specular workflow
  - Specular workflow has been unconditionally disabled. There is no meaningful mapping of URDF specular color (phong based materials) to UsdPreviewSurface (simplistic PBR based materials) so we ignore specular color for now. This gives results more closely matching `rviz` & `urdfviewer`
- Fixed URDF Parser to allow invalid `axis` specification on `fixed` joints
  - Many sample assets have `axis="0 0 0"` on fixed joints, which is meaningless but harmless
- Fixed URDF Parser to handle errors when no links exist in the file

## Documention

- Update Concept Mapping document to reflect new stance on material overrides

# 0.1.0a1

# Known Limitations

## USD Data Conversion

- **Joint Conversion**
  - Calibration and Safety Controller have no equivalent in `UsdPhysics` nor `NewtonPhysics` schemas
  - These are all converted as custom attributes on the Joint prim
- **Geometry Conversion**
  - No other file formats beyond OBJ/DAE/STL are supported
  - For DAE files, only "TriangleSet", "Triangles", "Polylist", and "Polygons" are supported
  - For OBJ files, only objects with faces are supported (i.e. no points, lines, or free-form curves/surfaces)
- **Visual Material and Texture Conversion**
  - Projection shaders for basic geometry primitives (box, cylinder, sphere) are not implemented
  - More accurate PBR materials (e.g. OpenPBR via UsdMtlx) are not implemented
- **Other Elements**
  - Transmission, Gazebo, and other out-of-spec URDF extensions have no equivalent in `UsdPhysics`
  - These are all converted as Scope Prims with custom attributes to retain the data

## Using the USD Asset in other USD Ecosystem applications

- The USD Asset contains nested rigid bodies within articulations.
  - Support for nested bodies in UsdPhysics is fairly new (as of USD 25.11), and some existing applications may not support this style of nesting.
